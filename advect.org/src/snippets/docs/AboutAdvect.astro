                Advect is a library for creating web components (Custom Web Elements). It provides a pattern for creating and loading custom web elements with NO build step. It aims to unlock the power of modern browser features without the lock-in to the javascript build ecosystem that is common amongst other libraries (PHP/Java/ASP/Py devs rejoice ðŸ˜‰).
                <br>
                <br>
                Components can be defined in <code> &lt;template&gt;</code> embeded in your HMTL or easily loaded from any endpoint serving html.
                <br>
                <br>
                At its core Advect is 3 parts.
                <ul>
                    <li>The core library which loads/registers your components via <code> &lt;template&gt;</code> and <code> &lt;script type="text/adv"&gt;</code> tags. </li>
                    <li>The <a href="/docs/advect-view">AdvectView</a> (<code>&lt;adv-view&gt;</code>) component which is a stand alone component which handles templating powered by the <a target="_blank" href="https://eta.js.org/">Eta.js</a> library. </li>
                    <li>The <a href="/docs/custom-elements">AdvectElement</a> class which serves as a base class for your custom elements and provides access to the systems features.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Advect is inspired by libraries <a target="_blank" href="https://alpinejs.dev/">Alpine.js</a>, <a href="htmx.org">HTMX</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://shoelace.style/">Shoelace</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://swiperjs.com/">Swiper</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://lit.dev/">Lit.js</a> (Even though they may catch some strays from me, T'is all love ðŸ˜™) which all give a lot of BANG for your integration buck. Advect aims to K.I.S.S. users on the forehead and make your web project that much simpler.
